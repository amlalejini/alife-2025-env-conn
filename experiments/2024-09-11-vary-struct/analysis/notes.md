Next steps:

(1) I still want to try a larger environment (more tasks) to see if that amplifies any tiny differences in rate of task evolution
(2) Pick an initial spatial structure to screen for hot spots. Any thoughts on which structure to start with? I'm thinking maybe comet-kite (because it nicely breaks down into core nodes vs tail nodes), hierarchical clique ring, or linear chain.
