# 2024-11-26 Barbells Flat CPUs experiment

Re-run barbells (from 11-05), but flatten CPU distribution in Avida.


NOTE: These runs didn't finish in reasonable time period: it's slow to search for appropriate neighboring location to place offspring in cliques.

- Ideas for next steps:
  - Switch from cliques on ends of barbells to "small-world" random networks
  - For now, run with faster-to-execute graph structures.
