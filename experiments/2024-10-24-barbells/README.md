Changes
- Go back to seeding single common ancestor (ensure phylogeny is rooted)
- Switch to replace largest age/merit in neighborhood (oldest)

For many spatial structures, population did not reach capacity, making it hard to draw any conclusions from these runs (aside from differences in how long it takes for populations to establish on a spatial structure).
